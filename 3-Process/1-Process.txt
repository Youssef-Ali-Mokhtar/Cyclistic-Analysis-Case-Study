What tools are you choosing and why?
-Spreadsheets (excel): easy to use
-SQL: good for processing large amount of data
-Python and R: Good for processing large amount of data + 
               lots of stuff can be done within a single block of code

Have you ensured your dataâ€™s integrity?
-The whole dataset has the right data types.
-The data is trustworthy because it's internal.
-The data is not a sample, and it's not biased, 
 because it doesn't focus on a certain group.

What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?
-removed 47 duplicate values, 704007 unique values remain.
-All columns have the right data type.
-Splitting: start_time is split into start_date and start_time
            end_time is split into end_date and end_time
-validated tripduration by subtracting start time from end date
-Unwanted data like trip_id and bike_id got removed
-Sorted chronologically by start_date then start_time
-Filling missing values: "birthyear" filled with the average value = 1984
                         "gender" filled with "Unknown"
-No typos so far
-All columns are trimmed
-Outliers removed from "birthyear" by graphing it out using histogram, values below 1940 are removed.
-Added "day_of_week" (sunday = 1, saturday = 7)
